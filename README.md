# ur3-translate

A modest attempt at translating Sumerian language using deep learning.
Two neural networks (Seq2Seq without attention, and Google's Transformer) have been trained
on a fraction of the corpus of Ur III administrative texts.

A complete explanation is [available here](https://alpof.wordpress.com/2019/01/11/sumerian-translation-using-deep-learning/).

The results of translating un-annotated texts are given in the two files *urIII_seq2seq_translations.txt* and *urIII_transformer_translations.txt*.
